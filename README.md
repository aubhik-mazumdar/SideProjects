# Side Projects
A github repostory for my side projects.


## Github Emojis
I've created a search engine for the Github emojis API. Simply search for the emoji.

## Prototypes.js
A JS library for missing functionality for: arrays, strings, html-objects and numbers. It includes basic and advanced mechanics. It also has built in handy functions. All are ES6, so ether use this in an ES6 compatible browser or transpile it.
